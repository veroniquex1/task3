        <h2>Cat</h2>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wj4KsQgg/cat.jpg" alt="cat">
        <p>Cats describe the part of my personality that is playful and independent. Like
            cats, I also enjoy warmth and taking naps.

        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yYfpf65T/one-piece.jpg" alt="anime">
        <p>Anime has so many genres and one of my favourites are shonen. The characters have super
            human abilities and many of them have have characteristics I admire such as determination
            and loyalty.

        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J7SGjj73/nature.jpg" alt="forest">
        <p>I chose nature as a way of describing myself because it is expansive and self regulating.
            I enjoy being out in nature and the quiet that comes with it.
